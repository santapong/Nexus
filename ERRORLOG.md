## Severity Reference

| Severity | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `critical` | Data loss, security issue, or silent incorrect behavior that corrupts state |
| `high` | Incorrect behavior that affects task outcomes or agent memory |
| `medium` | Incorrect behavior that degrades quality but doesn't corrupt state |
| `low` | Minor issue, cosmetic bug, or suboptimal but not wrong behavior |

## Status Reference

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `open` | Error discovered, fix not yet implemented |
| `fixed` | Root cause addressed, verified by test |
| `mitigated` | Partially addressed, full fix deferred to BACKLOG |
| `wont-fix` | Known issue, accepted risk, documented reason |

## Error Entry Template

Copy this template for each new error.

```markdown
## ERROR-{NNN} — {short description}

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Severity:** critical | high | medium | low
**Status:** open | fixed | mitigated | wont-fix
**Found by:** {agent_name or 'human'} during {task or context}
**Affected files:** {list}

### What happened
{Exact description of the incorrect behavior. Be specific.
Include: what was expected vs what actually happened.}

### Root cause
{Why did it happen? Wrong assumption? Missing guard? Race condition?
Missing test? Bad default? Dependency behavior?}

### Fix applied
{What was changed to fix it?
Include: commit hash or PR number if available.
If status is 'open': describe what fix is needed and who should do it.}

### Prevention
{What prevents this from happening again?
- New test name + location
- New rule added to AGENTS.md or CLAUDE.md (section number)
- New guard or validation added
- Dependency version pinned}

## Known Patterns to Watch For

These patterns have caused problems in agentic systems generally.
Check for them during code review and testing.

### Pattern A — Memory write after publish

**Risk:** Agent publishes result to Kafka before writing episodic memory.
If memory write fails, the task appears complete but has no memory record.
**Watch for:** Any code where `kafka.publish()` appears before `memory.write_episode()`.
**Required order:** memory.write_episode() → kafka.publish() → always.

### Pattern B — Silent exception swallow

**Risk:** `except Exception: pass` hides failures. Tasks appear to complete but
produced no useful output. No log entry. No trace. Impossible to debug.
**Watch for:** Any bare `except` block without a log statement and re-raise.
**Required pattern:** Always log + (handle or re-raise).

### Pattern C — Sync I/O in async context

**Risk:** Blocking call inside an async function freezes the entire event loop.
All other tasks waiting on the event loop are blocked.
**Watch for:** `requests.get()`, `open()`, `time.sleep()` inside async functions.
**Required pattern:** Use async equivalents or wrap with `asyncio.to_thread()`.

### Pattern D — Duplicate Kafka message processing

**Risk:** Kafka delivers messages at-least-once. Without idempotency keys,
the same task can be processed twice. Double LLM calls, double memory writes,
double tool calls (possibly double emails sent).
**Watch for:** Any Kafka consumer that doesn't check a Redis idempotency key first.
**Required pattern:** Check `idempotency:{message_id}` in Redis db:3 before processing.

### Pattern E — Token budget not checked before LLM call

**Risk:** Agent makes LLM calls without checking remaining budget. Task exceeds
the per-task token limit, cost spikes, and the agent doesn't pause for human input.
**Watch for:** Any `await self.llm.run(...)` not preceded by `await self._check_budget(...)`.
**Required pattern:** Always _check_budget() → then llm.run().

### Pattern F — Irreversible tool without approval gate

**Risk:** Agent writes a file, sends an email, or pushes code without human approval.
Action cannot be undone.
**Watch for:** Any tool in `adapter.py` that has side effects but no `require_approval()` call.
**Required pattern:** Every tool with side effects in the real world MUST call `require_approval()`.

### Pattern G — Hardcoded Kafka topic string

**Risk:** Topic string typo is only caught at runtime, not at lint time. Misrouted
messages are silently dropped or go to wrong consumers.
**Watch for:** Any string literal matching a known topic pattern (e.g., `"agent.commands"`)
outside of `kafka/topics.py`.
**Required pattern:** Always `Topics.AGENT_COMMANDS`, never `"agent.commands"`.
